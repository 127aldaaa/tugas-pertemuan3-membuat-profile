      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <div class="text">
        <p>I am an undergraduate student in Educational Systems and Information Technology at the Indonesia University
          of Education, Purwakarta campus. My main interest lies in the intersection of education and technology,
          particularly how IT can be applied to support learning and community development. Beyond the classroom, I
          actively engage in organizational activities, part-time work, and creative projects that have shaped both my
          skills and perspectives </p>

        <p>Within the student community, I am involved in the PSTI Student Association (Himpunan Mahasiswa PSTI),
          Cabinet Aksaracita, serving in the Internal Affairs Department. This role allows me to collaborate with peers
          across cohorts, manage internal communication, and strengthen essential soft skills such as leadership,
          teamwork, and time management. Through this, I have learned that organizations are not merely about events,
          but about fostering solidarity and supporting members’ growth.</p>

        <p>Professionally, I work part-time at Senyum Mandiri Foundation, a non-governmental organization, where I
          contribute to the media and creative team. My role focuses on developing digital content, designing
          communication strategies, and strengthening the organization’s branding to better connect with the community.
          This experience has shown me how IT and creativity can be powerful tools to drive social initiatives and
          create meaningful impact. </p>

        <p>I am also a member of Ruang Peka, a student activity unit where I serve as a peer counselor. This role has
          taught me empathy, active listening, and providing emotional support, reminding me that human connection and
          sensitivity are just as important as logic and technical skills. </p>

        <p>In addition, I actively participate in various committees inside and outside the campus, which sharpen my
          adaptability, problem-solving, and teamwork under pressure. To further improve my technical expertise, I am
          currently joining an IT bootcamp to strengthen my skills in data analysis, coding, and web design. Alongside
          that, I explore entrepreneurship by running a small business in digital design, combining creativity with
          business sense.</p>

        <p>Amidst all these roles, my studies remain my top priority. In fact, my academic journey provides the
          foundation, while organizational, professional, and entrepreneurial activities complement and enrich my
          learning process. Balancing these diverse responsibilities has taught me discipline, prioritization, and
          consistency.</p>

        <p>In short, I consider myself an active, adaptive, and curious individual who constantly seeks opportunities to
          grow. My journey across IT, student organizations, social work, and entrepreneurship is not a collection of
          separate activities, but a holistic process that shapes me into someone who aspires to create both
          professional and social impact.</p>
